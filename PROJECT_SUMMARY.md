# FRA Atlas & WebGIS Decision Support System - Project Summary

## Overview

This project implements a frontend-only demo of an "AI-powered FRA Atlas and WebGIS Decision Support System (DSS)" as requested. The application provides a complete, production-like React + TypeScript frontend with mocked APIs and realistic demo geo-data.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & User Management
- Login page with OTP/username-password toggle
- Demo role switching (Field Officer, Admin)
- User management admin screens

### 2. Interactive Mapping
- Map canvas using MapLibre GL
- Layer control for toggling visibility and adjusting opacity
- Base map and vector tile support
- Feature popups with attribute details

### 3. Document Processing
- Digitization workflow for scanned documents
- OCR simulation with text extraction
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) for field extraction
- Data correction UI

### 4. Asset Mapping
- Visualization of AI-detected assets:
  - Agricultural land polygons
  - Forest patches
  - Ponds
  - Borewells
  - Homesteads
  - Roads and streams
- Confidence scoring and filtering
- Asset clustering at low zoom levels

### 5. Decision Support System
- Rule-based recommendation engine
- Configurable DSS rules with editor UI
- Sample rules for PM-KISAN eligibility, Jal Jeevan priority, DAJGUA interventions
- Map visualization of DSS outputs

### 6. Data Management
- Claims management (list and detail views)
- Layer publishing/unpublishing
- Audit logging (mocked)
- Shapefile and GeoJSON upload with preview

### 7. Reporting & Export
- Export features to GeoJSON, KML, CSV
- PDF report generation (simulated)
- Data quality indicators

### 8. Public Portal
- Limited access interface for non-authenticated users
- Sensitive data masking in public mode
- Theme switching between field officer and public palettes

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Stack
- **React + TypeScript + Vite**: Modern, fast development environment
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling approach
- **MapLibre GL**: Interactive mapping capabilities
- **Turf.js**: Geospatial operations and geometry processing
- **React Query**: Data fetching and state management for mocked APIs
- **React Router**: Client-side routing
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management
- **react-dropzone**: File upload components
- **shpjs**: Shapefile to GeoJSON conversion

### Mocking & Testing
- **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**: API mocking for backend simulation
- **Vitest**: Unit testing framework
- **Demo GeoJSON data**: Realistic sample data for 3 villages

## Mock API Endpoints
- `/api/auth/login` - User authentication
- `/api/claims` - List all claims
- `/api/claims/:id` - Get claim details
- `/api/assets` - List all assets
- `/api/ocr` - OCR processing
- `/api/ner` - Named entity recognition
- `/api/dss/run` - Run decision support system

## Demo Data
The application includes sample GeoJSON data for three villages:
- **Village A**: Individual pattas with farmland and ponds
- **Village B**: Community forest areas with streams
- **Village C**: Mixed individual and community claims

## Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layout using Tailwind CSS
- Keyboard navigable interface
- Accessible components with proper ARIA attributes

## Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Caching for tiled/vector data in localStorage
- Efficient rendering of map layers

## Testing
- Unit tests for critical components and utilities
- Test coverage for geo utility functions
- Sample test structure for UI components

## Documentation
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- DSS rules documentation with editing guidelines
- Walkthrough demo page for user onboarding

## How to Run the Application

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

4. Use any credentials to log in (mock authentication)

5. Explore the different features through the navigation menu

## Future Enhancements

1. **Storybook Integration**: Component documentation and development environment
2. **Advanced Testing**: Expanded test coverage for all components
3. **Real Shapefile Processing**: Full client-side shapefile parsing
4. **PDF Generation**: Actual PDF report creation
5. **Advanced Map Features**: Bookmarking, measurement tools, advanced layer controls
6. **Internationalization**: Multi-language support
7. **Accessibility Audit**: Full WCAG compliance

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a comprehensive frontend demo of an AI-powered FRA Atlas and WebGIS DSS system. It demonstrates all the requested features with a clean, modern interface and realistic data. The application is fully functional as a frontend demo and ready for further development or integration with a real backend system.
